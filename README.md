A minimalist family tree editor and viewer hosted on GitHub Pages.
It allows anyone without a technical background to create and host their family tree for free.   
It uses the [React D3 Tree library](https://github.com/bkrem/react-d3-tree) in order to generate a visual family tree from data that you input.

## Setting up your own family tree (one time setup)
1. Create a copy of this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top right:  
![Fork](screenshots/Fork.png)
2. From your newly created repository, go to a file named 'data.json' by clicking the 'Go to file' button:  
![Go to file](screenshots/go_to_file.png)
Type `data.json`:  
![data.json](screenshots/data.json.png)
3. Edit the file:  
![edit](screenshots/edit.png)  
Let's start by also giving your family tree a `title` of your choosing:  
![Family Tree Title](screenshots/family_tree_title.png)  
4. Describe what your changed and click 'Commit changes':  
![Commit changes](screenshots/commit.png)
5. This will trigger your family tree website to get generated with your latest changes!
6. Switch to the 'Actions' tab to monitor its progress: ![Actions Tab](screenshots/actions_tab.png)
7. The final step is to enable your website by switching to the 'Settings' tab  
![Settings Tab](screenshots/settings_tab.png) 
 and change the source branch to 'gh-page'  which should have been generated after step 6 is completed (you may have to wait a few minutes before it shows the gh-pages option):

8. If it all goes well, you will be presented with the link to your site as shown in the screenshot above.
Make sure you keep note of it! **It may take a few minutes for the link to start working.**

## Usage
The family tree launches by default in view mode.
Click the thin gray banner to the left in order to switch to edit mode:

This exposes all the editing options

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd your-project-folder-name

```

> **Tip:** If you'd prefer to use your own app for development instead of the demo, simply run `npm link react-d3-tree` in your app's root folder instead of the demo's :)
